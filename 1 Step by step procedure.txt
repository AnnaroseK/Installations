1.Write code for sum() int sum.c
2.Write code for square() in square.c
3.Create user defined header fun.h
  3.1 header file will begin with defining the file, if file not defined i.e., #ifndef __FUN_H__ #define __FUN_H__
  3.2 next mention the function prototypes, structure definition and class definition
4.The main function is written in test.c 
5.For a program with 3 or 4 files, run in cmd (for compilation): gcc file1.c file2.c test.c -o output (Here output.exe file will be created havig the output)
  Run the code: output.exe
6.However if there are more than 50 files, it is difficult to write all the names. So we create a make file. A Makefile is created using Notepad++ without having any extension (saved as all type)
7.In Makefile type

#comments
#Target : dependency
#<TAB>Command

all.exe : test.c sum.c sqr.c
	gcc test.c sum.c sqr.c -o all.exe
	
run : all.exe
	all.exe
 
Now go to cmd and type : make for compilation, and make run for execution

NOTE: For cmd to open in a particular folder, go to the folder, go to address bar, select the location and type cmd.
